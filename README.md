## Problem Statement

🧩 Problem Statement (PS-12: Social Common-Ground Finder)

In today’s socially diverse environment, groups often struggle to identify events or activities that satisfy conflicting individual interests and varying geographic locations. While each member may have distinct hobbies, preferences, and travel constraints, existing platforms primarily cater to individual users, failing to address the complexity of group-based decision making.


## Solution Overview

EventVibe is a web-based Social Common-Ground Finder designed to help groups discover optimal events by analyzing shared interests and geographic constraints. The platform focuses on group-centric decision making rather than individual recommendations.

The system enables participants to explore events using structured filters such as interests, location, date, and group size, allowing groups to identify activities that maximize common hobbies while minimizing travel effort. In parallel, organizers are provided with a dedicated interface to create and manage events, ensuring relevant and well-categorized event listings.



## Description

EventVibe is a role-based web platform that helps groups find optimal events by analyzing shared interests and locations. It enables participants to discover suitable events while allowing organizers to create and manage event listings efficiently.
