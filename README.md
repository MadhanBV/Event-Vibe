## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, discovering and engaging with events can be challenging. Users often struggle to find events that match their interests and preferences, leading to missed opportunities for social interaction and personal growth.


## Solution Overview

EventVibe addresses this problem by providing a streamlined platform where users can easily discover events tailored to their interests. With an intuitive interface and robust search capabilities, EventVibe makes event exploration and engagement effortless.



## Description

Event Vibe is a web-based platform that helps individuals or groups discover shared interests, values, and perspectives.  
The platform promotes constructive dialogue, social harmony, and positive collaboration by highlighting common ground rather than differences.  
Users submit preferences, opinions, or interests, and the system analyzes them to visualize shared points effectively.
